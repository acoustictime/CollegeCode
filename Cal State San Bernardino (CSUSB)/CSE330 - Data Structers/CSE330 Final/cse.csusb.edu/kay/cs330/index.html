<strong>Home work 4: Alternative Deque Implementation.</strong> Due Wednesday, Mar. 14.
<br>
An alternative implementation of the Deque compared to the lab's implementation is to use one ARRAY instead of two vectors. 
In this implementation the Deque is maintained in the middle of the array AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. In this way there is room for growth on both ends of the Deque without the costly allocate-copy operations.
<br>
Modify lab 7 Deque to implement this alternative. Do not change the interface (operation names and parameters) of the Deque, only the internal implementation should change. Start with the following declaration and add the definition of all the member functions from lab 7 such as push_back(), erase(), operator[](), etc. Also, center_it() must be completed:
<pre>
template &lt;class T>
class Deque {
public:
        typedef DequeIterator&lt;T> iterator;

        Deque(): my_capacity(10) { buffer = new T[10];  front_ptr = next_back = 10/2; }
        Deque(const unsigned int size, const T & initial): my_capacity(size), front_ptr(0), next_back(size) {
                buffer = new T[size];
                for (int i = front_ptr; i < next_back; i++)
                        buffer[i] = initial;
        }
// ... more code goes here ...
        T & front() { assert(front_ptr < next_back); return buffer[front_ptr]; }
        T & back() { assert(front_ptr < next_back); return buffer[next_back - 1]; }
// ... more code goes here ...
protected:
        T * buffer;
        int front_ptr, next_back;
        int my_capacity;
        void center_it();
};
</pre>
Here buffer is the array, my_capacity is the capacity of the buffer, front_ptr points to the front element of the Deque, and next_back points to the element just to right of back element of the Deque. Note next_back - front_ptr is the size of Deque.
For example, in the following configuration:

<style type="text/css">
table.sample1 {
	border-width: 0px;
	border-spacing: ;
	border-style: outset;
	border-color: gray;
	border-collapse: collapse;
	background-color: white;
}
table.sample1 th {
	border-width: 1px;
	padding: 1px;
	border-style: inset;
	border-color: gray;
	background-color: white;
	-moz-border-radius: ;
}
table.sample1 td {
	border-width: 0px;
	padding: 5px;
	border-style: inset;
	border-color: gray;
	background-color: white;
	-moz-border-radius: ;
}
</style>

<table class="sample1">
<tr>
<td> &nbsp; 0  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 1  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 2  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 3  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 4  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 5  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 6  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 7  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 8  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 9  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; 10 </th>
<th> &nbsp; 25 </th>
<th> &nbsp; 30 </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  </td>
<td>     </td>
<td>  </td>
<td>  </td>
<td>     </td>
<td>  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 0  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 1  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 2  </td>
</tr>
</table>

my_capacity = 10, front_ptr = 6, next_back = 9, and Deque size is 3.
The array index ranges from 0 to 9, and the Deque index ranges from 0 to 2.
<br>
Suppose two push_back() operations arrive:
<br>
push_back(10);
<br>
push_back(15);
<br>
On the second push_back(), center_it() is called and the following configuration results:
<table class="sample1">
<tr>
<td> &nbsp; 0  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 1  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 2  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 3  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 4  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 5  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 6  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 7  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 8  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 9  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; 10 </th>
<th> &nbsp; 25 </th>
<th> &nbsp; 30</th>
<th> &nbsp; 10</th>
<th> &nbsp; 15</th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
<th> &nbsp; </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>  </td>
<td>  </td>
<td>  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 0  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 1  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 2  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 3  </td>
<td> &nbsp; 4  </td>
<td>  </td>
<td>  </td>
</tr>
</table>

This buffer can handle two more push_back() operations, but on the third operation a larger buffer must be allocated.
This is part of the "policy" used for this implementation. Let's implement the following policy: every time an insert operation (push_back(), insert(), or push_front()) is called and the Deque is trying to grow beyond one of the ends of the buffer, center_it() is called. center_it() first decides whether to enlarge the buffer.
If Deque size is > my_capacity/2, then capacity is enlarged by a factor of two (my_capacity *= 2;). Otherwise capacity is not changed. In both cases, the Deque is centered in
the middle of buffer.
<br>
Hand in a printout of your program (Deque.h). The test programs from lab 7 should compile and run with the new implementation without any errors. State the percentage completed and time complexity of all functions.

<strong>Home work 3: Course Registration System.</strong> Due Wednesday, Feb 29.
<br>
Complete the Course Registration System given in section 9.3.2 (pages 196-202).
<br>
You are to give your own <tt>main()</tt> and two input files together with all
the code given in the section and other functionality not listed.
<br>
First and foremost, if you've already not done so, refer to the errata list to fix the errors in this section.
<br>
Second, read this section as many times as necessary to understand it! To be able to complete this program
you must have a clear understanding of what the author has already done. Only then
you can begin to complete the program.

<strong>Home work 2: Four-card Solitaire.</strong> Due Mon, Feb 13.
<br>
Write a C++ program to play four-card solitaire.
The rules of the game are as follows:
<menu>
<li> In each round the player draws four cards.
<li> Each card is placed face-up on top of one of four columns.
<li> A card can be discarded when it is one of the four top cards, has a suit equal to one of the other three top cards, but has a lower rank.
<li> The highest-ranked card is Ace, the next highest-ranked card is King, etc. Deuce (2) is the lowest-ranked card. 
<li> An Ace on top of a column can move to an empty column or on top of another Ace.
<li> The player wins when all 52 cards are drawn, 48 are discarded, and one Ace per column remains.
</menu>
You may play this game <a href="http://www.singaporemahjong.com/sol/sol.html">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
Reuse as much code as possible from war.cpp and war2.cpp to write this program.
<br>
First, use war.cpp to develop and debug your program. Then refer to war2.cpp where <tt>srand()</tt> and <tt>time(0)</tt> calls are used
to make successive runs different.
<br>
<br>
Note in the War program Ace has the lowest rank; here Ace has the highest rank. The slightest modification
accommodates this requirement!
<br>
<br>
In each round of play, your program should prompt the player for the column number.
If the top card in that column is smaller than one of the other three top cards,
the card must be discarded.
If the top card selected is an Ace, then the player must specify which column it has to move to.
After each selection, the new
configuration of the columns must be displayed similar (but not necessarily exactly) to the following:
<pre>
$ a.out
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
    2 Diamonds    Ace Diamonds   Jack Diamonds     10 Hearts  

Enter a column number (0 to draw four new cards): 1
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
                  Ace Diamonds   Jack Diamonds     10 Hearts  

Enter a column number (0 to draw four new cards): 3
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
                  Ace Diamonds                     10 Hearts  

Enter a column number (0 to draw four new cards): 0
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
    6 Hearts      Ace Diamonds      2 Clubs        10 Hearts  
                  Ace Clubs                      Jack Spades  

Enter a column number (0 to draw four new cards): 3
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
    6 Hearts      Ace Diamonds                     10 Hearts  
                  Ace Clubs                      Jack Spades  

Enter a column number (0 to draw four new cards): 2
Ace to where? 3
   Col 1           Col 2           Col 3           Col 4 
    6 Hearts      Ace Diamonds    Ace Clubs        10 Hearts  
                                                 Jack Spades
</pre>
A high-level sketch of the algorithm follows. You must develop this algorithm further before starting on the code.
<ol>
<li>
Draw four cards, place each card on a different column
<li>
Prompt the player for a column number
<li>
Compare the top card of the column selected with the other top cards, discard this card if it's smaller than any of the other three
<li>
If the top card is an Ace, then prompt for a column to move it onto
<li>
Repeat the above three steps until the player decides to draw four more cards
<li>
Stop if there are no more cards left, otherwise repeat from the top
</ol>
It might seem the best approach is to declare a vector of stacks to represent the columns. After all
in this algorithm we only need access to the top card in a column. Although this is true and one could implement the
program this way, printing the configuration of each column every time around the main loop becomes
unnecessarily difficult. Implement your columns as a vector of vectors:
<pre>
vector&lt;vector&lt;Card> > column(4);
</pre>
Note the space between > and > is necessary.
<br>
Now to access the suit of the top card on column 2, you may use:
<pre>
column[2].back().getSuit()
</pre>
Or to access the 3rd card in column 0:
<pre>
column[0][3]
</pre>
Hand in a print-out of your program and a typescript of a sample run.

<strong>Homework 1: Exercise 8, page 21.</strong> Due Wednesday, Jan 18.
<br>
Your program should input the numbers from standard input until end-of-file.
As you enter each number increment the number of numbers (<tt>n</tt>). You need <tt>n</tt> 
to calculate both the average and variance.
<br>
Your program should consist of two functions: <tt>main()</tt> and <tt>variance()</tt>.
In <tt>main()</tt> you input the numbers in an array, call and pass the array to <tt>variance()</tt>,
and then output the result.

What are the access rules with private and protected inheritance?
<br>
Take these classes as examples: 


<pre>
 class B                    { /*...*/ };
 class D_priv : private   B { /*...*/ };
 class D_prot : protected B { /*...*/ };
 class D_publ : public    B { /*...*/ };
</pre>
 
None of the derived classes can access anything that is private in B. 
<br>
In D_priv, the public and protected parts of B are private. 
<br>
In D_prot, the public and protected parts of B are protected. 
<br>
In D_publ, the public parts of B are public and the protected parts of B are protected (D_publ is-a-kind-of-a B).
