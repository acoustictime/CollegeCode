<h1>CSE 330 Lab 2: Time Complexity</h1>

<p>
Empirically test the assertion that the execution times of
selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort
algorithms are in O(n<sup>2</sup>).
To do this, implement and execute each algorithm using vectors of different sizes
and record the execution times. If an algorithm is indeed in 
O(n<sup>2</sup>), there must exist a constant c such that for any n the
execution time is c * n<sup>2</sup>.
Implement each algorithm and first make sure the corresponding program works correctly.
Then for each n determine the execution time and
the value of n<sup>2</sup>. Now working your way backward you could compute the 
value of c by dividing the execution time by n<sup>2</sup>. If the values
of c are roughly equal for each n then the algorithm is indeed in O(n<sup>2</sup>).
</p>
You could use the <tt>time</tt> command to measure how much time your program takes for a given value of n. Run your program as follows:
<pre>time a.out > output</pre>
where the user enters n and the program generates a vector (of size n) of random integers in the range [0-1,000,000).
The program then proceeds to sort and output the numbers into <tt>output</tt> file. 
<strong> It is important to make sure that n is a user input and the above output redirection is used. Otherwise, the typescript of the sample runs would get unmanageably too large!</strong>
After the program terminates, the <tt>time</tt> command prints real, user, and system times. You are interested in user time. Type 
<pre>man time</pre> to learn more about this command.
<br>
Run each program 10 times starting with n = 1,000 and incrementing n each time by 1,000.
<br>
Hand in a printout of each program, the typescript of all 10 runs for each program, and the following completed table for each program/algorithm:
<br>
<br>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>n</td> <td>n<sup>2</sup></td> <td>Exec Time (sec)</td> <td>c = Time / n<sup>2</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1,000</td> <td>1,000,000</td> <td> ... </td> <td> ... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2,000</td> <td>4,000,000</td> <td> ... </td> <td> ... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> ... </td> <td> ... </td> <td> ... </td> <td> ... </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 10,000 </td> <td> 100,000,000</td> <td> ... </td> <td> ... </td>
</tr>
</table>

<br><br>
Use STL vector v to implement all three functions where n is the size of the vector. The algorithms for the functions follow:

<pre>
//selection sort
for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
    for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)
        if (v[i] > v[j])
            swap(v[i], v[j])
</pre>

<pre>
//bubble sort
for (i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
    for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
        if (v[j] > v[j+1])
            swap(v[j], v[j+1])
</pre>

<pre>
//insertion sort
for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
    for (elem = v[i], j = i-1; j >=0 and elem < v[j]; j--)
        v[j+1] = v[j]
    v[j+1] = elem
</pre>
