 Briefly describes the text's method for designing objects including the names

 What happens to a system operation in an SSD when you start to design objects

 Explain operation contracts.

 Explain the Command-Query Separation Principle

 An object `a:A` sends message `m` to `b:B`. Draw a communication diagram
that shows this.  What does this diagram tell us about the
classes `A` and `B` -- list `all` the facts you can deduce.
 Class `A` is a generalization of of Class `B` and class `B` is associated
with class `C`.  Draw the DCD showing these facts.  Are objects in class 
`A` also associated with objects of class `C`?

 Write down what the following diagram means as a set of true facts about 
the classes:
