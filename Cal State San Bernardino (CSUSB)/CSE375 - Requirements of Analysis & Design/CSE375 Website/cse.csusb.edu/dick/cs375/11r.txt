.Image 11diagram.png [Use case to DCD]
 A `Widget` has  method called `zark` with data `knobs:Number` 
Draw a sequence diagram and a communication diagram showng 
that when a `Widget` gets a `zark(knobs)` message it creates a `Wodget` 
called `kid` with parameter `knobs` and then sends `kid` a `foobar` message.
-- draw a partial DCD that supports this interaction. 
 An object `a:A` gets a message `m1` and as a result sends message `m2` to
`b:B`. Draw a sequence diagram
that shows this.  What does this tell us about the
classes `A` and `B` -- list all the facts you can deduce from this interaction.
Sketch a partial DCD that supports this interaction and shows as many facts as
you can.
 How do DCDs and interaction diagrams relate?
