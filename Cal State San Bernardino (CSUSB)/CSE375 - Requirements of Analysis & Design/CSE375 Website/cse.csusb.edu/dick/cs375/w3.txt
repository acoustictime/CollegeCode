. Hint: KISS
Keep It Simple!

Choose diagraming tools that you like and that
produce sharable images -- gif or png for example.

. Embrace Change
By the way.... drawing a domain model often improves your
understanding of the requirements so you should note
the change in your use cases etc., but
I don't need to see them -- yet.

. Example from Winter 2004
