on Thursday and must be handed in (however incomplete) on the
following Tuesday for 10 points max. Late work scores zero. Any
work can score lots of points.  

This time people from CS372 will  briefly present their
projects to the class. People who are not from CS372 should choose a team to join
or propose their own project.

You also need to look at
.See ./projects.html
to get an idea of what is going to happen.  Also see
.See ./w1.html
the first assigned piece of project work.  Today we
will get started on preparing for this. At the start of the next
class hand in a first draft of:
.List
 Name of the project
 List of team members
 One paragraph vision
 One Paragraph business case
 Some users and what they will want to get out of the system

the following week.
. Assigned Work for next time
(Assigned Reading): Study the syllabus and schedule
plus pages vii..40 (Preface, Chapters 1,2, and 3) in the book.
Do as many of the review questions
.See ./02r.html
as you have time for.  Copy one question and your answer on to a
piece of paper with you name printed on it for grading.
Hint: You should read the "history" sections of each chapter, but I
won't be testing your knowledge of the history of the subject.
(Next): class meeting 2.
