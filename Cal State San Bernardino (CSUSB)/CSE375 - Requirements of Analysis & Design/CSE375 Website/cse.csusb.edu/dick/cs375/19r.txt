. Review Questions 19 -- UML Interaction Diagrams and DCDs
 Name the two types of interaction diagrams and give very simple example of the
same interaction using one type of diagram and the other.  Add a DCD that supports
the interaction.
 How do you show that one class is responsible for creating an object?  Show the creation UML
notation for both
types of interaction diagram.  How might you show this in a DCD?
 How do you show that a class is responsible for executing an operation rather than an object?
 How do you show an operation that will be `static` in C++ or Java?
 How can you show an array and an element in an array in the UML?
 What is a `found message`?   What does it mean?
 How do you show a returned object in a sequence diagram?  
 Explain these structures: alt, loop, and opt.
 How do you show an action (x=x/2.0; for instance) in a sequence diagram?
 Explain `ref` and `sd` and the relation between them.
 In a communication diagram -- how many messages per link?  How are the sequenced?
 I have messages numbered 1, 2, 3, 2.1, 1.1, 3.1, 1.2, 3.2.  In what sequence are they
actually sent?
 What does this mean in a communication diagram: [gender = male]? And what does
*[i=1..20]?
 What is the purpose and form of a DCD? How does it relate to a Domain Model?
 Invent an example and use it to demonstrate three different ways of showing an attribute in a UML
class diagram.
 What information can you attach to an operation in a UML DCD?
 How do you document the code for an operation in a UML DCD?
  Explain "keyword", "constraint", and "stereotype" in the UML.
  Draw a diagram that illustrates (using your own invented example) "generalization".
  What is an "abstract" class?
  How do you show that class "A" depends on class "B".
  How do you show an "interface" in the UML? 
  WHat does an association class do?
