. If we continue our 372 project is this a re-inception
Yes -- I guess it is.  The Traditional Systems Analysis tends to
provide a lot of useful input into Inception that will need
re-evaluation.

. What are the difference between artifacts in the inception phase and 
later phases
First: as the project proceeds the artifacts are refined: edited, improved,
etc..

Second they are initially incomplete and get more complete in each phase.

. How does skill interact with methodology
Older methodologies attempted to `deskill` software development.
This means replacing personal abilities by given (`no brain`)
procedures.

Modern `agile` processes stress people and their skills
more than the procedures.  They stress the skill of picking
procedures (and artifacts) that work at the particular time and
project.

.  Why do people still use the waterfall.
Tradition. Comfort.  Ignorance. Egotism.

Also the text books are lagging behind the research and practice.

Also some projects (very few) have no risks and so
the waterfall works for them and is likely to be most efficient.
