Suppose that you have to develop the CSUSB Inventory program for Facilities
Services. This software tracks all the equipment and furniture on campus. 
It enables us to find where things have gone to. Each thing is in one place
and places can have any number of things. CSUSB Inventory is used when we 
move, install, replace, repair, and remove things from service.  It helps us
find things and put them in  the right place.  Places include classrooms 
and stores.
