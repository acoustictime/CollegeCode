In chapter one it discusses how a critical ability in OO development is to skillfully assign responsibilities to software objects because it influences robustness, maintainability, and re-usability.  This sounds a little subjective to me because one developer may think differently than another when it comes to assigning the object.  How do you know if the responsibility is properly assign to the object?
<p>
The main purpose of the book is teach you this skill.  It is not easy. It
is a bit subjective, at first.  But, it can be learned...  You should
find that, at the end of the class, that it is quite rational and
explainable:  we assigned the responsibility for zarking a widget to
objects in the Widget class because Widgets are the <span class="InlineFormula">Experts</span>.
<p>
<H1><a name="1.2 pp 6 -- Nine fundamental principles">1.2 pp 6 -- Nine fundamental principles</A></H1>
In chapter 1.2 the author points out that there are &quot;nine fundamentals principles in object design and responsibility assignment are presented and applied.&quot; What are those nine fundamentals principles?
<p>
They are listed opposite the inside of the front cover of the book... and
in my notes on the WWW.  Look for &quot;GRASP&quot;.
<p>
<p>
<H1><a name="1 page 11 Forward and reverse engineering">1 page 11 Forward and reverse engineering</A></H1>
What does the author mean by &quot;forward engineering?&quot;
<p>
It proceeds from analysis to design to implementation -- with no feed back.
<p>
Opposite of looking at code to figure what is going on in the designer's and analysts'
minds: reverse engineering.
<p>
<p>

Notice the steps and diagrams used in this example.  Do not forget them.
They will be part of your project, future classes, quizzes, and the final.
<li><a name="Steps">Steps</A>::=following,

<li>Define some use cases

<li>Define some interaction diagrams
<li>Define a design class diagram -- -- --(<a name="DCD">DCD</A>)<br>
</ol><br>
<p>
An iteration is not complete until we have coded and tested our analysis
and design.  So I have taken the diagrams on page 10 and coded them in C++.
Study:
[<A href="DiceGame.cpp"> DiceGame.cpp </A>]
and
[<A href="Die.cpp"> Die.cpp </A>]
to see the C++ code that I developed.
<p>
I also used a pair of unit tests
[<A href="testDiceGame.cpp"> testDiceGame.cpp </A>]
and
[<A href="testDie.cpp"> testDie.cpp </A>]
in C++.  You should compare the code I produced with the diagrams and text
in the book.  By the way, in the process of coding and testing this rough
design I found a couple of methods that the book does not mention but are
implicit in the use case description on page 8 -- the user needs a way
to find out the score and also to see if they have won.  It helps to show
all the data flows using a System Sequence Diagram like this
<p>
<img src="02DiceGameSSD.gif" alt="Dice Game Systems Sequence Diagram">
<p>
which needs a more complex DiceGame class:
<p>
<img src="02DiceGameClasses.gif" alt="Dice Game Classes">
<p>
<H1><a name="Java code for Section 1.5">Java code for Section 1.5</A></H1>
These are a direct translation of the above C++ into Java.
[<A href="Die.java"> Die.java </A>]
[<A href="DiceGame.java"> DiceGame.java </A>]
Notice that a simple unit test is included with each class. It makes
debugging and developing much easier.
<p>
Note:  At some time I want to show how to combine these to &quot;Domain Layer&quot;
classes  with some &quot;User Interface&quot; code to create a web applet.
<p>
<H1><a name="Warning about the example 1.5">Warning about the example 1.5</A></H1>
In practice we do not &quot;define ALL the use cases&quot; before we start
the defining the domain model.  Instead we should focus on only
a few use case, a partial domain model, some of the interactions, and so
add to the design and code.  We eat the elephant, one bite at a time.
<p>
<H1><a name="2 page 13 3 perspectives">2 page 13 3 perspectives</A></H1>
Can you clarify the differences in the meaning of Class in the three perspectives listed in this chapter.
<p>
<br><ol class="List">
<A name="Conceptual" class="Key"> Conceptual </A>
-- describes objects that are outside the computer + ideas in the stakeholders heads.
Concepts not code.
<A name="Specification" class="Key"> Specification </A>
-- Describes the kinds of objects we expect to need to make the software work and the
relationships between them.
<A name="Implementation" class="Key"> Implementation </A>
-- Blueprint for code.  Or a reverse engineered diagram of the actual code.
</ol><br>
<H1><a name="1 pp 12-13 -- perspective">1 pp 12-13 -- perspective</A></H1>
There are 3 perspectives; Conceptual, Specification, Implementation. Do you need to use all of them or can you just use one of them when doing a project?
<p>
Expect and plan to use all 3.  You'll be using conceptual models most
at the start (with a few specs and implementations).... and by the transition
phase it'll be all Implementation.
<p>
The good news is that many of the things you draw in a conceptual model
can be copied into Specifications and Implementations.
<H1><a name="1 pp 13 -- Specification vs implementation perspective">1 pp 13 -- Specification vs implementation perspective</A></H1>
<li>There is one example in the book for both Specification and Implementation Perspective. What is the obvious difference between the two that would make specification perspective seldom used and most software-oriented UML diagramming assume an implementation perspective?
<p>
Programmers really hate thinking about the real world and
hate writing (and reading) specifications.  They seem to love
the code, the whole code, and nothing but the code??
<p>
<H1><a name="2 page 13 expressing the logic of the program">2 page 13 expressing the logic of the program</A></H1>
In the software implementation for the dice example, how is the logic of the program depicted within the UML programming language? Or, it is just an abstraction of the software components?
<p>
In this book and course interaction diagrams will be used to express the
logic.  UML2 sequence diagrams have enough features to express most any
logic you could want: iteration, selection, sequence, functions, arithmetic,
etc....
<p>
When one needs to express a complex algorithm in the UML we use
Activity diagrams.   But these will not be required in this course.
<p>
<H1><a name="1 pp 3-16 -- OOD: Principles and Patterns">1 pp 3-16 -- OOD: Principles and Patterns</A></H1>
Please explain the concept of patterns in more detail.
<p>
A pattern is a way to solve a class of problems.  It resolves the conflicting
forces well enough for it to be useful.  It should also work well
with other patterns to form a &quot;Pattern Language&quot;.
<p>
The history starts with a set of patterns for architecture: rooms,
buildings, towns, ... by Christophe Alexander (circa 1979).  One of
his patterns:
<hr><ol class="Box">
When adults enter a room they often need to put something down or pick it
up.
<p>
Children like to hid under things...
<p>
Therefore,
<li><span class=Formula>Put a shelf around a room just above the height of a child and just below the hand of an adult.</span>
</ol><hr>

<p>
<H1><a name="Domain Model vs Design Class Diagram">Domain Model vs Design Class Diagram</A></H1>
<li>A common error that looses points in this class is to confuse the model of
the world arround the software(Domain) with the model of the software itself (Design)
<li>+++ The classes in a Domain model are sets of similar real objects
<li>+++ The system is not not yet real and so is NOT in the domain model.
(Don't panic -- it appears soon enough, some where else).
<li>+++ Domain classes don't have operations/functions.  Real objects don't
work like objects in software.
<li>++ Most design classes are inspired by doamin classes.
<li>++ Design class diagrams may have extra classes in them that are needed
for technical reasons.  They aree not real objects, so they are not put in a
domain model.
<li>+++ A design class Diagram is derived from a set of interactions.

<H1><a name="The Cake Image of Agile Development">The Cake Image of Agile Development</A></H1>
Perhaps some images may help.  If I offered you a cake to eat...
<p>
<img src="cake2.png" alt="[3layered cake = requirements+design+code with tests on top]">
<p>
Would you plan to eat it one layer at a time: (1) all the Requirements,
(2)all the Design, (3) Code it all and then (4) do
the tests:
[<A href="cake2fragile.png"> cake2fragile.png </A>]
or in slices:
[<A href="cake2agile.png"> cake2agile.png </A>]
with a little bit of each layer and a test on top?
<p>
In this class I will covering a particularly flexible process for taking one slice at a time.
<p>
<H1><a name="Example of an iterative project -- the FRiendly EDitor(FRED) project.">Example of an iterative project -- the FRiendly EDitor(FRED) project.</A></H1>
I implemented a Friendly Editor for my students in 10 weeks in the fall
of 1982, while bootstrapping the CSci dept, using a language I was
not familiar (BASIC) with, on a completely strange operating
system (RSTS).
<p>
This was only possible
because I started with a nearly empty program and grew it
one feature at a time.
<H1><a name="A Common Error -- iterations and phases">A Common Error -- iterations and phases</A></H1>
Always remember that a phase can have several iterations in it. An iteration does not contain
any phases!
<p>
Each iteration has a mix of disciplines (requirements, domain, design, code) and
so a phase will have several repetitions of a little life cycle.  However the mix of
disciplines tends to be different in each phase.
<H1><a name="Images of RUP">Images of RUP</A></H1>
The PDFs of the text omit this image.

[<A href="../../../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_RUP_Workflows2.html"> File:RUP_Workflows2.gif </A>]
<p>
Also search Google for &quot;RUP Image&quot; for lots of similar processes.
<p>
<H1><a name="2 page 16 Early testing">2 page 16 Early testing</A></H1>
&quot;Activities such as load testing will prove if the partial design and implementation are on the right path.&quot;  This seems to occur at a relatively early phase in the design process.  Is an early prototype of the program created for users to test the program this early, or is this merely  an invitation for users and stakeholders to witness the iterative development on paper (namely observation of the UML diagrams and Pseudocode)?
<p>
It should be a real, high quality, incomplete implementation that tests out the feasibility
of the approach.
<p>
Sadly in this class we won't get to this.
<p>
<p>
<H1><a name="Unified Process phases and disciplines for this class">Unified Process phases and disciplines for this class</A></H1>

</table><br>(Close Table)<br>
The disciplines are like tools that are used in many phases.
However in the early phases we normally
do more business modeling and requirements
than Design and Implementation.  In later phases this is
reversed.
<H1><a name="1 page 17 Domain Models">1 page 17 Domain Models</A></H1>
What is a domain model and how does it relate to the UML process?
<p>
UML is not a process.  It is a family of 13 types of diagram.
The process we will be learning is the Unified Process or UP.
UML is the &quot;Unified Modeling Language&quot;. We use it to prepare
artifacts (documents).  The UP will guide what diagram we will be drawing
at any particular time.
<p>
A Domain Model is also known as a Business Model. Creating and changing one
is part of the Unified Process. It describes the
real world that your software will interact with.  A full business model
will include many kinds of diagrams and text documents describing how
the business works, the data that it uses, the hardware and software
platforms to be used.  It should also have a conceptual class diagram
that summarizes the kinds of things and relationships between them that
are important to the stakeholders.
<p>
In this course we will often refer to the conceptual model (classes of
real objects and their relationships) as &quot;The Domain Model&quot;.  It will
be an important source for the classes that we put into our designs.
<p>
In other words, real world ideas (domain model) will inspire the structure
(Design class diagrams) of our software.  As a result, the software should
(1) fit the world better, (2) be easier to understand, and (3) be easier
to change when the world makes a small change.
<p>
The way these artifacts(documents) fit together is shown inside the front
cover of the hardback edition of our text book.
<H1><a name="2 page 18 Length of an iteration">2 page 18 Length of an iteration</A></H1>
How would you estimate what the proper time would be for the iteration period?
<p>
Each project and <span class="InlineFormula">each iteration</span> may have a different deadline.
There are no simple and accurate rules.   I like short deadlines -- in senior projects
I ask students to show me what they have got every week -- verbal report. What works?
What can you do next week.  This is the best length for college work.   Similar to
the XP weekly cycle.   Most methodologists think 1 week is too short.
<p>
The time for an iteration should be enough to analyze, design, implement, and test
something.
<p>
Key point: fix length and <span class="InlineFormula">then</span> choose what to do in it.
<p>
The simplest rule I know is to use past performance to predict the future.
Suppose you already have implemented a dozen similar
features and they have each taken an average of one 40 hour week...  then
adding another similar feature should take another 40 hour week.  So with a two week
iteration -- add two such features.
<p>
<H1><a name="2 page 23 Waterfall process">2 page 23 Waterfall process</A></H1>
I understand the idea of the waterfall cycle (process) but i don't
understand how that name describes or even relates to my understanding of
the waterfall cycle.  Is it because you don't see it coming when you start?
<p>
Interesting question.  It comes from a paper by
<A name="Winston Royce" class="Key"> Winston Royce </A>
&quot;Managing the development of large software systems&quot;
(Proc IEEE WESCON (1970) pp328-339)
which had a picture with data flowing down from analysis to Design etc.
like water down a series of steps...
[<A href="http://www.holub.com/goodies/royce.waterfall.pdf"> royce.waterfall.pdf </A>]
(PDF).  Oddly the paper is arguing that the
<A name="waterfall process can not work." class="Key"> waterfall process can not work. </A>
Instead Royce proposed the ideas of iteration, prototyping,
and starting with code.  People ignored this part of his message.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<H1><a name="2 page 23 waterfall polluting agile process">2 page 23 waterfall polluting agile process</A></H1>
Why is it that iterative projects with a &quot;waterfall&quot; influence are likely doomed to failure as if they were strictly waterfall projects?
<p>
They loose the feedback from implementing and testing.  A recent government project
had to tams working in parallel. At the the end of 18 months the agile team had
80% of the project running, the waterfall team had not finished the specification.
<p>
<H1><a name="Alternatives to UML">Alternatives to UML</A></H1>
Are their any other systems besides UML that can model software development? If so what are their names?
<p>
Yes -- but they have died.... HOOD, OPEN, ...  see

Look at the risks involved -- tackle the riskiest thing first.

<H1><a name="Waterfall">Waterfall</A></H1>
Do you know of any software development company that actually was successful using the waterfall method?
<p>
None come to mind.... but dozens of simple projects are done in one iteration = waterfall.
However, Alistair Cockburn, who has done a lot of consulting on large scale projects,
has observed successful projects using <span class="InlineFormula">any</span> process!  He also seen <span class="InlineFormula">all</span> processes fail.
He writes
<hr><ol class="Box">
<li>The people on the projects were not interested in learning our system.
<li>They were successfully able to ignore us, and were still delivering software, anyway.
<li>Almost any methodology can be made to work on some project.
<li>Any methodology can manage to fail on some project.
<li>Heavy processes can be successful.
<li>Light processes are more often successful, and more importantly, the people on those projects credit the success to the
lightness of the methodology.

I'm having trouble understanding the difference between unified process and rational unified process can you explain the differences
<p>
They have the same philosophy, phases, and come from similar experiences.
<p>
The differences are:
<br><ol class="List">
<li>RUP is more complex and complete -- more disciplines are involved.
<li>You buy RUP from IBM.
<li>I don't think Craig Larman is licensed to teach RUP.

You can compare the UP  and RUP with Barry Boehm's

UP is described a method as well as XP and SCRUM. Can UP be considered then a model or a framework? Can these adjectives be used interchangeably to describe those interactive processes?
<p>
The author does not clarify the terms. It is a bit confusing!
Model, Method, Framework, Process?
<p>
<li><a name="Model">Model</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">description of something of interest in a project</span>.
Example: A description of the things a user wants to do with the project, a
class diagram of classes in code, etc.
<li><a name="Method">Method</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">steps to take to achieve a goal</span>.
Example: SP, OOAD, ...
<li><a name="Framework">Framework</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">loose structure with customizable bits</span> -- can be a method, Model or
a process. Describes a family of possibilities.
<li><a name="Process">Process</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">how a team works together and schedules its time to complete a project</span>.
Examples: XP, SCRUM, ...
