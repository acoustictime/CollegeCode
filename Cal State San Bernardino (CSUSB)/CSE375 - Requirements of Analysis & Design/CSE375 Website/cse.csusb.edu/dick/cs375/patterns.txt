.Open Patterns and Principles
. What is a Pattern
A pattern can be a recurring structure in a domain or business model.  It can be a
pretty useful way of solving a recurring problem in coding a program.  It can
be a recurring way of dividing up the responsibilities (functionaliity) into a maintainable
set of objects.  The key word is
.Key recurring
-- if it has not been used 3 times then it is not a pattern.

. Domain and Business Model Patterns
In a typical busines or doamin model there will be many simple patterns that appear.

The first set of patterns come from the fact that Entity-Relationship modelling is also
business modelling.  The following examples come from my CSE372 (Computers in Organisations) course.
Here are some classic analysis patterns that I've noticed over the years.  Use this list to help
discover ERD models:
.Set
.Key Sentences lead to Relations:
Sentences often describe relationships between entities: Jo Doe is married to Jane Roe. Student
Joe Coyote is enrolled in CSE372. Joe Coyote is working as a Librarian on the "FIS" project
team in CS372. 
.List
 A simple relationship between only two entities can be shown as simple link. RJBOTTING
teaches CSE372.

.Image ERD1.gif Simple Relation between two Entities

 But many-to-many and `n`-ary relationships are best treated as entities. For example: An
Enrollment links a Section  to a Student....

.Image ERD2.gif Relationship between 3 Entities

 A sentence can relate entities of the same type.  For example a Marriage relates two People.  The
different occurrences play different `roles`.  For example in a traditional a Marriage has one
Person who is playing the roll of `husband` and a second person playing the role of `wife`.

.Image ERD3.gif Relationship with two roles of one type

 Some sentences describe an entity in terms of its attributes.  When an entity has a property that is
a value of a simple data type: a number, Boolean, character, string, or one of a number of
enumerated values, then it is best shown as an attribute. For example a Person may have
attributes: gender, age, height, ...

.Image ERD4.gif Entity with attributes

 Notice: an entity can have attributes and be related to other entities. A
Relationship can also have attributes, and be related to other Entities.  
However be careful not to record the same fact in multiple
ways.

.Key Master and Detail Pattern
Example: A Sale has a number of Items.  An Order has
a number of order items. 

.Image ERD5.gif master (1)-(*) detail.

.Key Pattern -- Actor plays a Role for a Time
A Person can be a Student in a Quarter.  A Person can Work on
campus in a Quarter. They can be a Teacher in another Quarter.  Combinations of roles are
possible at one time.

.Image ERD6.gif Actor--Role--Time

.Key Events Time and Place Pattern
Event of a particular Type takes place at a Time and a Place. Example:  CSE372 meets 4-6pm
in JBH146 during winter quarter 2007.

.Image ERD7.gif Event at Place in Time of Type...

.Key Description and Instance Pattern
Example: A product describes a sales Item.
Also good for entities that are grouped by shared attribute values. Example:
A Course has many Sections. 

.Image ERD8.gif Description(1)-(*)Instance.

.Key Part and Whole Pattern
Building has many rooms.  A Week has many days. Dog has 4 legs. Project
has team members.

.Image ERD9.gif Whole(1)---Part

.Key Access Point Pattern --
An entity selects a collection of entities needed for a
process.  Example: DeansList of Students with GPA>3.9. This example is an
"Operational Master" and expresses a functional requirement as an object.
Another version is when when the Access Point links to a list or set of
objects: for example an Inventory of Items on the shelves in a Store,
a list of people with accounts, a catalog of all the books in a library,
or a Ledger describing resources owned by a enterprise.  
.Image ERD10.gif Access(1)---Instance

.Key General and Particular Pattern --
A Student and a Teacher are special types of Person.  In an ERD the
special types are shown with a 0..1 multiplicity in the General.  In general,
you can have a whole hierarchy of special types. There are ways to document
whether the special types overlap or not (UML Generalization).  Avoid this detail in
simple ERDs.

.Image ERD11.gif General(1)---(0..1)Particular

.Key The Enumeration pattern
It is very common to define an entity type not by its relationships and attributes,
but by listing its possible values.  For example: Gender, Race, Boolean, ... Either document the
values elsewhere or use the <<enumeration>> stereotype in the UML for the second of these. Do
not confuse listing the attributes of an entity: Person has age, gender, eye color, ... with listing the
possible values of an
enumerated date type: Gender = {male, female, unknown}. 
Another example: student status = (fresher, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate).

.Image ERD13.gif Type={value1, value2, ...}

By the way it is a common error to forget the "<<enumeration>>" and so turn the possible values of
a simple entity into the attributes of a complex and erroneous one.

. Software Design Patterns
Reoccuring solutions to complex and subtle problems in software design -- for example
allowing the software to work with an expanding number of interface frameworks without
recompiling everything each time.

.See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
on the Wikipedia.
. GRASP -- General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns
From Craig Larman
.See ../cs375/text.html

Expert::=`allocate a responsibility to a class that has the information`. Look
in both the design classes and the domain model to find a type of object 
that knows enough to handle the responsibility.  Knowledge includes
having the data, and also knowing who has got the data!  Sketch

.Image InformationExpertPattern.gif [Look for info in the domain]

Creator::=`creating an object should be the responsibility of a class that is closely related to the created object`.  Notice that you always need at least
one way of creating an object that doesn't depend on already having an object
of that type already.  So which class or object is close to the 
created object.  Sketch 

.Image ./CreatorPattern.gif [owners and close friends make good creators]

Or else you can use a GoF $Factory -- a
$Pure_Fabrication.

Low_coupling::=`Assign a responsibilities so that class depends less on other classes using a "need to know basis"`. Organize responsibilities so that classes do not depend on each other two much.

High_cohesion::=`Design elements to have strongly related and focused responsibilities"`.

Controller::=`Assign the responsibility for handling system event messages to a class representing either the whole system, device, or subsystem, or representing the use case /scenario within which the system event occurs`. 
Controllers often translate $IDs_to_Objects where the objects are in
the Domain Layer and are Information Experts.
Note: Choose controllers carefully to avoid low cohesion.

.Image ./ControllerPattern.gif [Possible controllers]

Compare
.See MVC
(Model-View-Controller)
and see $IDs_to_Objects below.

Polymorphism::=`Give the same name to services in different objects when 
the services are similar or related`. Classify objects, using 
inheritance/generalization, to allow the right version of a service to be 
executes for the object in question. 
You can call
all your Pets in the same way.... and the Dogs come to you, and the Cats
think about it, for example.

.Image ./PolymorphismPattern.gif [Class send message to object of right type]

Example
.See Strategy
in the $GOF patterns below.

Pure_Fabrication::=`assigning a highly cohesive set of responsibilities to an artificial convenience class that doesn't represent a problem domain concept`.

.Image PureFabrication.png [Assign operation to an invented class of object]

Indirection::=`Assign a responsibility to a class that knows where to find an object that can complete the task`, Avoid coupling by an intermediate (smart?) object.  

.Image IndirectionPattern.gif [Put object in the middle]

You can have indirect access to an abstraction without knowing
the precise concrete implementation of the abstraction.
$Polymorphism makes sure you get the right behavior.

PV::=Protected_variation.
Protected_Variation::=`Identify points of predicted variation or instability and assign responsibilities to create a stable interface around them`.

Many $GoF combine two or more $GRASP patterns.  For example $State
is a $Pure_Fabrication that uses $Indirection to protect
a class from state changes ($PV).

Abstract_factory::$GoF=`To allow a client to create an object without knowing what type of object it is design a common interface for creating families of similarly or related objects`. 
See $Factory.
This is an example of a $Pure_Fabrication that uses $Polymorphism to $Protect_Variation.

Adapter::$GoF=`Introduce a class to convert the interface of one component into another interface`.  Think plugs and sockets. `make one interface for one or more suppliers`.
Unlike $Proxy and $Bridge, an adapter converts different interfaces into one common one.
Uses pure fabrication to protect variation in an interface and ise 
indirection and polymorphism to make easy to extend.

Factory::=`an object/operation/class is designed solely to create other kinds of object`.
A factory is an alternative to a constructor in a class.  Because it
is a member of a different class (the factory) we can get objects without
having to know precisely what class they are instances of.  Other
patterns need the ability to create concrete implementations of
an abstraction -- but without knowing which implementation has been
chosen.
This is not a GoF pattern,
see $Abstract_factory, $FactoryMethod, and $Builder.

FactoryMethod::=`an operation that creates an object`.  THis provides flexibillity
that a constructor is not able to provide -- for example different names
or run selection of the concrete type of object.
Typically there is
a hierarchy of classes all providing the same operation to create objects of
different types.  Similarly the resulting object should be a specific
object in a hierarchy of products.

Observer::$GoF=`An object that implements the operations that let it subscribe to learn about other objects`.
Objects that need to see what an object is doing can join a collection 
maintained by the observed object.  These are subscribers. The observed

operations that a listed in an interface that the observers all implement.
It is also possible for an object to subscribe other objects as observers.

State::$GoF=`When an object changes behaviors (responsibilities) with time, place the state in a different State object and place the different behaviors in special kinds of State object`. 
Note: in most programming language can not change its class!  Also
note that an efficient State implementation can use $Singleton for
the states.

, Exercise: redraw the UML diagram to show the changed classes between
State and State2.

Template_Method::$GoF=`A method in a class can use abstract operations (hooks) that are defined in a subclass so that the subclass provides some functionality while using the overall method`.
The classic example is a method that sorts a vector of data in a Sortable class
but uses an undefined "less_than" operation.  Other classes extend the Sortable and define "less_than" and can then sort the data `Their way, right away`.
.See http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TemplateMethodPattern
This result is also called a `Framework`.

Visitor::$GoF=`A visitor object can be taken to many or all the items in a data structure visiting each one and gathering information`, 
All visitors must implement the same interface which is called by the elements in an
`accept` method.  Diferent types of element can use different operations in the interface
if necesary.

standard_error_dialog::pattern. Have a standard user interface for reporting and sorting out errors.
. OO Principles
IDs_to_Objects::="An object is more than its ID or Key and more useful", so
when you are given an identifier or key you should replace it by the 
correct object as soon as possible. So, for example a $Controller will 
`find` the object that fits the ID.  The are several places the controller
can look to `find(id)` including an internal data structure listing all the
possible objects.   But using a data structure in the Controler means 
that the controller becomes responsible
for updating this list -- which means lower cohesion.  The Controler can not
send the `find(ID)` to the object because the object has not been found yet!
In Larman's text book in Chapter 17 the Controller `Register` sends the
`Store` a request to find the customer with a particular ID.

Of course, the Creator of an object has the information to store IDs and
their objects.  So a simple solution is to use the metaclass (where the
Constructor is).  
The diagram below shows the $Controller using a static
function to ask the Class that created the objects which one matches the 
`id`.  The returned object is then sent on to other objects to get the work
done:-

.Image ID2ObjectPattern.gif [Controller asks creator to convert ID to Object]

So, the creator `Class` in the above diagram will probably declare (in C++):
.As_is 		private: string id;
.As_is 		private: static map<string, *Object> objects;
.As_is 		public:  static Object* find(string id){return objects[id];
.As_is 		private: void addThis(string id){objects[id]=this;}
.As_is 		private: void removeThis(){objects.delete(Pair(this->id, this);}
.As_is 		public: Class(string id, ...) {... addThis(id); ...}
Note the above code needs testing and adapting to the particular situation.

If the exact class of the object is not known, the Controller cannot
turn to that class to find the id. For example, when I login
to MyCoyote it does not know whether I am a student or a faculty member, 
until it looks up my ID.  In this case we might well have decided to
use a $Factory object to construct the object we need.  The top level
one can keep track of all the IDs and the specific objects that are needed.
Then we use $Polymorphism:
.As_is 	Abstract_Class * object = Factory.getInstance().find(id);
The Factory::`find(id)` will return the address of an object in
one of the special concrete classes.  For example, it can return a Faculty
object or a Student object as a special kind of Person class, by $abstraction.

OO::=`Object Oriented Principles`, including $abstraction, $extension, $polymorphism, etc.

OID::=`Objects should know their own identity... and this can be expressed as a simple data item and stored in data tables, and hidden from the user`.

abstraction::$OO=`Variables and parameters should be declared as reference or pointers to abstract data types whenever possible, and containers as holding pointers to abstractions`.
Also known as 
.Key Aim high
-- allow your pointers to refer to abstractions
and then they can point to many special kinds of object.
For example(in C++):
.List
 Declare variable abstract and assign address of concrete:
.As_is 		List * example = new SpecialKindOfList(....);
.As_is 		Person * dick = new Faculty(....);

 Declare parameters as refs to abstractions
.As_is 		void zark(List &w){....}
 Declare containers as containing pointers to abstractions:
.As_is 		map<string, Person*> people;
.As_is 		people.insert(string("Dick"), dick);

extension::$OO=`Extend classes rather than reinventing the wheel`.  
$Polymorphism lets you add new functions to a class by putting them in a 
subclass.  This can be separately compiled and linked into the running 
system without having to compile the base class.

This dates back to the the theory of abstract data types and was
inherited by Meyer into objected oriented  coding style. 
This principle leads to code that is slightly more verbose
but very much clearer.  It also reduces bugs by the principle of
$Least_Surprise.

Least_Surprise::principle=`Whenever you design anything choose a design that
minimizes the surprises that the user may experience`.
Henry Ledgard proposed this for programming languages but it
also applies to user interfaces, common appliances, and object-oriented
classes.  Apple had a tendency to extend so that the user experiences
occasional pleasant surprises:  the user does the wrong thing
and the system does the right thing.  This is also called 
DWIM::="Do What I Mean".
This is a dangerous philosophy because it back fires.

Model_View_controller::pattern=$MVC.
.See http://www.pns.anl.gov/images/sciandproj/isaw/mvc.gif
MVC::pattern="Model-View-Controller", 
.Set
This patterns suggests separating
the logic of the data (Model) from the code that interfaces with the user
(View+Controler).
 Separate Model (data + ...) from View(what the user sees...) from Control (what the user can do...).
.See ./MVCinUML.gif
(UML diagram of View, Controller and Model packages)
 In some methods yo split Boundary, Control and Entity objects.
And use special icons for them:
.See ./icons.gif
(Graphic showing common icons and stereotypes).

The code that describes user interfaces is independent of the code
for the logic of an enterprise or application.  The appearance of
the user interface for a pay-roll should be separated from the
rules for calculating your with-holdings.
Neither should the choice of the user interface framework change
the calculations.  So the wise designer splits all the
user interface code into specialized classes that communicate
with the application specific classes.  This is splitting
the users "View" from the logical "Model".  
As a result the "Model" classes can reflect the Domain or Business
model and so are easier to understand and get right... and keep right.

As a result you can change the View (add a new one, rip out the AWT and
put in Swing, ...) without worrying about the payroll logic.

Here is a paper
.See http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1121341.1121453
that has a set of Java programs that access a time server and show the
user the time of day found on that server.  One program has a command line
interface, one has a menu driven ASCII interface and one a GUI interface,
but they share a common "model" of how to access the time server.  This
class never changes... each interface is implemented as a new class that
uses the model:

.Image VMSeparation.gif View -> Model

The diagrams in the paper are not correct UML, do not use them!

In general, there are lots of classes defining the user interface and
many classes in the Model.  In the UML use packages to contain them.

More strictly the user interface code is split into two sets of classes.
The View and the Controler.  Typically the user communicates with controlers
that change the model.  The view classes get data from the model
and are responsible for rendering it to the user.
.As_is 		User ---> Controler ----> Model -----> View -----> User

  Realities are domain models. We have the problem of integrating   different
views of the the `real world`
  Systems are the existing systems that we are replacing, using, modifying,
and even competing with.
  Techie include technologies, techniques, etc. and
describe what and how we might construct the software -- the decisions
we make: eg.-- use VB and MySQL.

The_Hollywood_Principle::pattern="Don't call us, we will call you",  
This is a common implementation
pattern for interacting with a framwork or operating system.  Instead of the program calling
the operating system when it needs to something, it waits to be called by the environment when events
happen. Detail at
.See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Principle
on the Wikipedia.
The $GoF $Observer pattern uses the Hollywood Priciple.
The classic $GoF $State pattern uses it to change the state.

that are useful in domain or business modelling.

Narasimha Bolloju

claims that if you know about a dozen common domain model patters
then you make better models, quicker.
Here is a visual summary
