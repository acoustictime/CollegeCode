.Open Exercises 10 UML Interaction diagrams
 Name the two types of interaction diagrams and give very simple example of the
same interaction using one type of diagram and the other.
 Copy the following diagram and label an object and a message.  What does it tell you about
the operations in the classes.

 Redraw the above diagram as a sequence diagram.
 How do you show that one class is responsible for creating an object?  Show notation for both
types of interaction diagram.
 How do you show that a class is responsible for executing an operation rather than an object?
 How do you show an operation that will be `static` in C++ or Java?
 How can you show an array and an element in an array?
 What is a `found message`?   What does it mean?
 How do you show a returned object in a sequence diagram?  
 Explain these structures: alt, loop, and opt.
 How do you show an action (x=x/2.0; for instance) in a sequence diagram?
 Explain `ref` and `sd` and the relation between them.
 In a communication diagram -- how many messages per link?  How are the sequenced?
 I have messages numbered 1, 2, 3, 2.1, 1.1, 3.1, 1.2, 3.2.  In what sequence are they
actually sent?
 What does this mean in a communication diagram: [gender = male]? And what does
*[i=1..20]?

 Explain these diagrams....

 The interaction diagram above tells you that the program will have a class
called C that has a particular operation in it.  What can you deduce about 
this operation?

 What do the interaction diagrams below tell you about the operations in class Die?

 Redraw the above sequence diagrams as comunication diagrams.

 What interaction diagrams might be drawn for this SSD?
.See ./09SSD060208.jpg
(Don't draw the diagrams ... just decide how many and what each would do).

 Here is the declaration of a member function in C++ & Java translate it into
a (1) sequence diagram, and (2) a communication diagram:
.As_is 		C++:  void A::f ( B* b) { b->g(this); C* c = new C; c->h(b); }
.As_is 		Java class A: public void f ( B b) { b.g(this); C c = new C; c.h(b); }

Answers:
.See ./10ExAf.png

 Here is some more C++ and Java code.... fit it into both your interaction diagrams
.As_is 		C++: void B::g ( A *a) { a->k(); }
.As_is 		Java class B: public void g ( A  a) { a.k(); }

 Given an incomplete pair of diagrams of the same set of events/messages
-- one communication and one sequence --
use the given information to fill in the blanks.

 Act out a given interaction diagram.

 Read a given diagram aloud -- read out what steps does it does.

 Given a dictation of a set of steps.... draw the diagram.
