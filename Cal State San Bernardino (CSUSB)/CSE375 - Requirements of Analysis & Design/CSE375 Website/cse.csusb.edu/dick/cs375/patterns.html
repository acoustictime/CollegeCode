<H2><a name="What is a Pattern">What is a Pattern</A></H2>
A pattern can be a recurring structure in a domain or business model.  It can be a
pretty useful way of solving a recurring problem in coding a program.  It can
be a recurring way of dividing up the responsibilities (functionaliity) into a maintainable
set of objects.  The key word is
<A name="recurring" class="Key"> recurring </A>
-- if it has not been used 3 times then it is not a pattern.
<p>
<H2><a name="Domain and Business Model Patterns">Domain and Business Model Patterns</A></H2>
In a typical busines or doamin model there will be many simple patterns that appear.
<p>
The first set of patterns come from the fact that Entity-Relationship modelling is also
business modelling.  The following examples come from my CSE372 (Computers in Organisations) course.
Here are some classic analysis patterns that I've noticed over the years.  Use this list to help
discover ERD models:
<ul class="Set">
<A name="Sentences lead to Relations:" class="Key"> Sentences lead to Relations: </A>
Sentences often describe relationships between entities: Jo Doe is married to Jane Roe. Student
Joe Coyote is enrolled in CSE372. Joe Coyote is working as a Librarian on the &quot;FIS&quot; project
team in CS372.
<br><ol class="List">
<li>A simple relationship between only two entities can be shown as simple link. RJBOTTING
teaches CSE372.
<p>
<img src="ERD1.gif" alt="Simple Relation between two Entities">
<p>
<li>But many-to-many and <span class="InlineFormula">n</span>-ary relationships are best treated as entities. For example: An
Enrollment links a Section  to a Student....
<p>
<img src="ERD2.gif" alt="Relationship between 3 Entities">
<p>
<li>A sentence can relate entities of the same type.  For example a Marriage relates two People.  The
different occurrences play different <span class="InlineFormula">roles</span>.  For example in a traditional a Marriage has one
Person who is playing the roll of <span class="InlineFormula">husband</span> and a second person playing the role of <span class="InlineFormula">wife</span>.
<p>
<img src="ERD3.gif" alt="Relationship with two roles of one type">
<p>
<li>Some sentences describe an entity in terms of its attributes.  When an entity has a property that is
a value of a simple data type: a number, Boolean, character, string, or one of a number of
enumerated values, then it is best shown as an attribute. For example a Person may have
attributes: gender, age, height, ...
<p>
<img src="ERD4.gif" alt="Entity with attributes">
<p>
<li>Notice: an entity can have attributes and be related to other entities. A
Relationship can also have attributes, and be related to other Entities.
However be careful not to record the same fact in multiple
ways.
<p>
</ol><br>
<p>
<A name="Master and Detail Pattern" class="Key"> Master and Detail Pattern </A>
Example: A Sale has a number of Items.  An Order has
a number of order items.
<p>
<img src="ERD5.gif" alt="master (1)-(*) detail.">
<p>
<A name="Pattern -- Actor plays a Role for a Time" class="Key"> Pattern -- Actor plays a Role for a Time </A>
A Person can be a Student in a Quarter.  A Person can Work on
campus in a Quarter. They can be a Teacher in another Quarter.  Combinations of roles are
possible at one time.
<p>
<img src="ERD6.gif" alt="Actor--Role--Time">
<p>
<A name="Events Time and Place Pattern" class="Key"> Events Time and Place Pattern </A>
Event of a particular Type takes place at a Time and a Place. Example:  CSE372 meets 4-6pm
in JBH146 during winter quarter 2007.
<p>
<img src="ERD7.gif" alt="Event at Place in Time of Type...">
<p>
<A name="Description and Instance Pattern" class="Key"> Description and Instance Pattern </A>
Example: A product describes a sales Item.
Also good for entities that are grouped by shared attribute values. Example:
A Course has many Sections.
<p>
<img src="ERD8.gif" alt="Description(1)-(*)Instance.">
<p>
<A name="Part and Whole Pattern" class="Key"> Part and Whole Pattern </A>
Building has many rooms.  A Week has many days. Dog has 4 legs. Project
has team members.
<p>
<img src="ERD9.gif" alt="Whole(1)---Part">
<p>
<A name="Access Point Pattern --" class="Key"> Access Point Pattern -- </A>
An entity selects a collection of entities needed for a
process.  Example: DeansList of Students with GPA&gt;3.9. This example is an
&quot;Operational Master&quot; and expresses a functional requirement as an object.
Another version is when when the Access Point links to a list or set of
objects: for example an Inventory of Items on the shelves in a Store,
a list of people with accounts, a catalog of all the books in a library,
or a Ledger describing resources owned by a enterprise.
<img src="ERD10.gif" alt="Access(1)---Instance">
<p>
<A name="General and Particular Pattern --" class="Key"> General and Particular Pattern -- </A>
A Student and a Teacher are special types of Person.  In an ERD the
special types are shown with a 0..1 multiplicity in the General.  In general,
you can have a whole hierarchy of special types. There are ways to document
whether the special types overlap or not (UML Generalization).  Avoid this detail in
simple ERDs.
<p>
<img src="ERD11.gif" alt="General(1)---(0..1)Particular">
<p>
<A name="The Enumeration pattern" class="Key"> The Enumeration pattern </A>
It is very common to define an entity type not by its relationships and attributes,
but by listing its possible values.  For example: Gender, Race, Boolean, ... Either document the
values elsewhere or use the &lt;&lt;enumeration&gt;&gt; stereotype in the UML for the second of these. Do
not confuse listing the attributes of an entity: Person has age, gender, eye color, ... with listing the
possible values of an
enumerated date type: Gender = {male, female, unknown}.
Another example: student status = (fresher, sophomore, junior, senior, graduate).
<p>
<img src="ERD13.gif" alt="Type={value1, value2, ...}">
<p>
By the way it is a common error to forget the &quot;&lt;&lt;enumeration&gt;&gt;&quot; and so turn the possible values of
a simple entity into the attributes of a complex and erroneous one.
<p>

<li><a name="Factory">Factory</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">an object/operation/class is designed solely to create other kinds of object</span>.
A factory is an alternative to a constructor in a class.  Because it
is a member of a different class (the factory) we can get objects without
having to know precisely what class they are instances of.  Other
patterns need the ability to create concrete implementations of
an abstraction -- but without knowing which implementation has been
chosen.
This is not a GoF pattern,

<p>
<li><a name="FactoryMethod">FactoryMethod</A>::=<span class="InlineFormula">an operation that creates an object</span>.  THis provides flexibillity
that a constructor is not able to provide -- for example different names
or run selection of the concrete type of object.
Typically there is
a hierarchy of classes all providing the same operation to create objects of
different types.  Similarly the resulting object should be a specific
object in a hierarchy of products.

<li><a name="IDs_to_Objects">IDs_to_Objects</A>::=&quot;An object is more than its ID or Key and more useful&quot;, so
when you are given an identifier or key you should replace it by the
correct object as soon as possible. So, for example a <a href="#Controller">Controller</A> will
<span class="InlineFormula">find</span> the object that fits the ID.  The are several places the controller
can look to <span class="InlineFormula">find(id)</span> including an internal data structure listing all the
possible objects.   But using a data structure in the Controler means
that the controller becomes responsible
for updating this list -- which means lower cohesion.  The Controler can not
send the <span class="InlineFormula">find(ID)</span> to the object because the object has not been found yet!
In Larman's text book in Chapter 17 the Controller <span class="InlineFormula">Register</span> sends the
<span class="InlineFormula">Store</span> a request to find the customer with a particular ID.
<p>
Of course, the Creator of an object has the information to store IDs and
their objects.  So a simple solution is to use the metaclass (where the
Constructor is).
The diagram below shows the <a href="#Controller">Controller</A> using a static
function to ask the Class that created the objects which one matches the
<span class="InlineFormula">id</span>.  The returned object is then sent on to other objects to get the work
done:-
<p>
<img src="ID2ObjectPattern.gif" alt="[Controller asks creator to convert ID to Object]">
<p>
So, the creator <span class="InlineFormula">Class</span> in the above diagram will probably declare (in C++):
<pre> 		private: string id;</pre>
<pre> 		private: static map&lt;string, *Object&gt; objects;</pre>
<pre> 		public:  static Object* find(string id){return objects[id];</pre>
<pre> 		private: void addThis(string id){objects[id]=this;}</pre>
<pre> 		private: void removeThis(){objects.delete(Pair(this-&gt;id, this);}</pre>
<pre> 		public: Class(string id, ...) {... addThis(id); ...}</pre>
Note the above code needs testing and adapting to the particular situation.
<p>
If the exact class of the object is not known, the Controller cannot
turn to that class to find the id. For example, when I login
to MyCoyote it does not know whether I am a student or a faculty member,
until it looks up my ID.  In this case we might well have decided to
use a <a href="#Factory">Factory</A> object to construct the object we need.  The top level
one can keep track of all the IDs and the specific objects that are needed.
Then we use <a href="#Polymorphism">Polymorphism</A>:
<pre> 	Abstract_Class * object = Factory.getInstance().find(id);</pre>
<li><a name="The Factory">The Factory</A>::<span class="InlineFormula">find(id)</span> will return the address of an object in
one of the special concrete classes.  For example, it can return a Faculty
object or a Student object as a special kind of Person class, by <a href="#abstraction">abstraction</A>.

This dates back to the the theory of abstract data types and was
inherited by Meyer into objected oriented  coding style.
This principle leads to code that is slightly more verbose
but very much clearer.  It also reduces bugs by the principle of
<a href="#Least_Surprise">Least_Surprise</A>.
<p>
<li><a name="Least_Surprise">Least_Surprise</A>::principle=`Whenever you design anything choose a design that
minimizes the surprises that the user may experience`.
Henry Ledgard proposed this for programming languages but it
also applies to user interfaces, common appliances, and object-oriented
classes.  Apple had a tendency to extend so that the user experiences
occasional pleasant surprises:  the user does the wrong thing
and the system does the right thing.  This is also called
<li><a name="DWIM">DWIM</A>::=&quot;Do What I Mean&quot;.
This is a dangerous philosophy because it back fires.

<li><a name="MVC">MVC</A>::pattern=&quot;Model-View-Controller&quot;,
<ul class="Set">
This patterns suggests separating
the logic of the data (Model) from the code that interfaces with the user
(View+Controler).
<li>Separate Model (data + ...) from View(what the user sees...) from Control (what the user can do...).
[<A href="MVCinUML.gif"> MVCinUML.gif </A>]
(UML diagram of View, Controller and Model packages)
<li>In some methods yo split Boundary, Control and Entity objects.
And use special icons for them:
[<A href="icons.gif"> icons.gif </A>]
(Graphic showing common icons and stereotypes).
<p>
The code that describes user interfaces is independent of the code
for the logic of an enterprise or application.  The appearance of
the user interface for a pay-roll should be separated from the
rules for calculating your with-holdings.
Neither should the choice of the user interface framework change
the calculations.  So the wise designer splits all the
user interface code into specialized classes that communicate
with the application specific classes.  This is splitting
the users &quot;View&quot; from the logical &quot;Model&quot;.
As a result the &quot;Model&quot; classes can reflect the Domain or Business
model and so are easier to understand and get right... and keep right.
<p>
As a result you can change the View (add a new one, rip out the AWT and
put in Swing, ...) without worrying about the payroll logic.

Here is a paper
[<A href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1121341.1121453"> 1121341.1121453 </A>]
that has a set of Java programs that access a time server and show the
user the time of day found on that server.  One program has a command line
interface, one has a menu driven ASCII interface and one a GUI interface,
but they share a common &quot;model&quot; of how to access the time server.  This
class never changes... each interface is implemented as a new class that
uses the model:
<p>
<img src="VMSeparation.gif" alt="View -&gt; Model">
<p>
The diagrams in the paper are not correct UML, do not use them!
<p>
In general, there are lots of classes defining the user interface and
many classes in the Model.  In the UML use packages to contain them.
<p>
More strictly the user interface code is split into two sets of classes.
The View and the Controler.  Typically the user communicates with controlers
that change the model.  The view classes get data from the model
and are responsible for rendering it to the user.
