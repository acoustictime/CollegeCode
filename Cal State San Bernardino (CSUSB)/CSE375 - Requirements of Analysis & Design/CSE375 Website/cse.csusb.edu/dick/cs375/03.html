The author repeatedly refers to &quot;risk.&quot; Exactly what is meant by risk in the software development process? Does this mean high cost? Difficult projects?
<p>
Each project has its own risks.  It may be the cost being arger than the
budget.  It may be some technical that we don't know.   It could be an area
of doubt about a particular requirement.
It could be the team itself.
<p>
Anything novel
is automatically risky and needs special attention.
<p>
<H2><a name="analysis of 10% of Use Cases">analysis of 10% of Use Cases</A></H2>
what is the best way to discover the most important of use cases without go into depth(within 10%)?
Are these cases obviously to find out?
<p>
You need to pick use cases that will tackle risks.   They must be
interesting.  Something that has a real
critical problem (or two) to solve.   It takes a little experience to spot
them.   Just follow your fear.
And look for novelty.
<p>
And if is all old stuff with little risk, pick something
that returns value to the clients and exercises a major part
of the logic (as far as you can see).
<p>
<p>
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 2 pp 41-59 -- SEI Quality Standards">Chapter 2 pp 41-59 -- SEI Quality Standards</A></H2>
Of the mentioned quality standards in the reading(ISO 9126, IEEE Std 830,
and IEEE Std 1061, and CMM/CMMI), which one is more popular and which is
more accepted?
<p>
I don't know.  The most popular standard is probably -- none.  In our
department we stick with the IEEE standards and cover CMM/CMMI style
quality improvement models in the graduate software engineering
class.   ISO is most popular in Europe.
<p>
<H2><a name="Business Cases">Business Cases</A></H2>
What difference between Use Cases and Business Cases? Do we have to
distinguish use case and business case? Is business case also have to
analysis within 10%?
<p>
The Business case is why the enterprise should spend time and money to develop the software.
It answers the question &quot;Why&quot; for the organization.   Use cases are about &quot;Why&quot; for particular people
in the organization.
<p>
A business case explains, in business terms, why this project is worth doing.
It is about the whole project.  It should give reasons like
&quot;save money&quot;, &quot;increase profits&quot;, etc..  A business case is
about many use cases -- and probably doesn;t name any of them.
<p>
A use case describes how one user gets something tangible out of the
system.   Many use cases are needed in a system....
<H2><a name="Chapter 3 pp 048-051 -- Inception">Chapter 3 pp 048-051 -- Inception</A></H2>
After inception, would requirement analysis follow this step, or is there
any other process that can take place in between?
<p>
Requirements analysis is not a step or phase in UP, it is a discipline.
Requirements analysis starts in <span class="InlineFormula">inception</span>.
It <span class="InlineFormula">continues</span> throughout the
project.... The ratio of <span class="InlineFormula">requirements work</span> to <span class="InlineFormula">designing</span> or <span class="InlineFormula">coding</span> etc.
changes as you change phases.
<p>
At anytime you may discover a new requirement:
<ul class="Set">
<li>A new law is passed by congress.
<li>A new boss.
<li>A stakeholder notices something obvious that you have not heard
of before.
<li>A prototype makes the user think again.
<li>Etc.
</ul>
<p>
As the project proceeds you expect to do less requirements analysis
and more design.  Ultimately it is all about coding with very little design
and analysis.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 3 pp 42-42 -- core application logic layer">Chapter 3 pp 42-42 -- core application logic layer</A></H2>
Can you please explain the difference between the application logic layer
and the other layers?
<p>
Consider web registration at CSUSB.  HTML is presentation or
Human-Computer-Interface
code.
The color of the user's screen is not part of the application logic area,
but the process for registering is.  The rosters for the classes are part
of the persistence layer but inserting a student in a roster is part
of the application layer.
<p>
There will be more on this later.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 Page 48 -- range of cost estimation in inception">Chapter 4 Page 48 -- range of cost estimation in inception</A></H2>
How close to a reliable range of cost for a project should you aim for during inception?
<p>
You are limited by the time and information available to make good
estimate.  You need what physicists call an &quot;Order of Magnitude&quot;
estimate of the costs -- is it 10s,100s,1000s, ... of dollars.
So rather than saying
&quot;plus or minus 10%&quot; or some such figure, it is more like doing your
best to check that the enterprise can
afford to develop the software.  Indeed the number is less important than thinking of a way to
develop the software that fits the budget.  For example by delaying an expensive but low value feature
can reduce the initial cost and move the cost to later and perhaps you may even wait for when people
really want the feature.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 page 48 -- When to stop a project">Chapter 4 page 48 -- When to stop a project</A></H2>
Projects that don't fit the enterprises needs and constraints should be
stopped.  Check out the term &quot;feasibility&quot; in cs372.
<p>
<H2><a name="What stops a project most">What stops a project most</A></H2>
I don't have any data but, I expect (1) time, (2) politics, and (3) costs are the
commonest project killers.
<p>
In any case --- it is more important to look at each project and detect
where it is weakest rather than having a prejudged rule.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 Page 50 -- Glossary">Chapter 4 Page 50 -- Glossary</A></H2>
What is an example of the type of thing you might find in the glossary artifact?
<p>
A glossary is a set of definitions for terms, words, symbols.  A place to turn when people
ask &quot;What do you mean by ______&quot;.
<p>
In my glossaries you find a lot of XBNF definitions:
<li><a name="definition">definition</A>::= term &quot;:&quot; &quot;:&quot; &quot;=&quot; description.
<li><a name="SSN">SSN</A>::=digit^10.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 Page 50 -- when to stop inception">Chapter 4 Page 50 -- when to stop inception</A></H2>
At what point do you say this is good enough and begin to document that iteration before moving on?
<p>
In practice you set up a time frame for inception and stop when it runs out.
<p>
You document as you go.... use documents to generate ideas and aim to get
something that runs before inception is done.
<p>
The moment you know that the project is worthwhile, and you know where to start.  Notice
you may have already written and tested some software to prove the concept.
<p>
But -- you may have to draw a line and say &quot;Enough preparation -- lets start&quot;.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 - Pages 58 - Topic: Inception">Chapter 4 - Pages 58 - Topic: Inception</A></H2>
It is understood that the Inception Phase is a collective gathering of enough information to establish a common vision on the seriousness and feasibility to move forward on a project.  How big role should the financial aspect [funding, expenses, capital, etc] play while conducting the Inception Phase?
<p>
Money acts as a constraint on what you can achieve.   You have to figure what you can achieve, given the money
available.   Check out some of the ideas and techniques in
[<A href="cs372.html"> cs372 </A>]
&quot;Computers in Organizations&quot;.
<p>
<H2><a name="Should money be considered an artifact?">Should money be considered an artifact?</A></H2>
<p>
That is called forgery!
<A name="Artifacts" class="Key"> Artifacts </A>
are things you make.
Money is a constraint on quality.
<p>
<H2><a name="Quality attributes and architecture">Quality attributes and architecture</A></H2>
What is the role of quality attributes when exploring architectural analysis?
<p>
Quality attributes tell how good an architecture is.  They can also guide the design process.
Just spotting the most critical quality attribute can focus you on the right way to tackle a complex
piece of software, in my experience.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 47 -- Analysis of 10% of Use Cases">Chapter 4 pp 47 -- Analysis of 10% of Use Cases</A></H2>
In the inception phase, you are supposed to come up with an in-depth
analysis of the most important 10% of your use cases.  Without going into
depth on all of the use cases, what is the best way to discover the most
important use cases?  Are they usually fairly obvious?  Is there a modeling
tool to help you discover them?
<p>
I don't think tools help, but experience does.   The tools help
you analyze the uses cases you choose as most important.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp * : Length of Inception Phase">Chapter 4 pp * : Length of Inception Phase</A></H2>
According to the book it is stated that inception should not be more than a
week for most projects. Isn't there a danger of underestimating the
feasibility of a project?
<p>
The feasibility of the whole project (including the hardware and people) should have
been examined before you start developing software.  So inception
just focuses on the cost and problems in developing the software.
<p>
Even so there is a risk of starting a project that will later fail.
But this is true of all software development.
We minimize this risk in the <a href="#UP">UP</A> by focusing on the riskiest parts
first.  In inception you pay attention to show stopper
requirements: use cases that are critical to the whole project and
are likely to expose the difficulties. We also look at quality
requirements (security? reliability? ...) that will need special
work.  We attempt to develop a proof of concept architecture that supports
these critical requirements.
<p>
A key output of the inception phase is a plan for the next iteration.
In later phases we also attack the problems before the sneak up on us.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 How do you spot the critical requirements">Chapter 4 How do you spot the critical requirements</A></H2>
Experience, examples, and practice.  This class will give you an opportunity
to gain some experience and practice.  A symptom of a critical requirement is
that it is valuable but has a number of unknowns that will effect design choices.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 50 : inception artifacts">Chapter 4 pp 50 : inception artifacts</A></H2>
Besides those listed in table 4.1, are there other artifacts that can be
used in the inception phase?
<p>
Yes!   You can include any artifact (something the team constructs,
gathers,...)
that helps you understand the problems and opportunities better.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 What are the most important artifacts on pages 50 and 58">Chapter 4 What are the most important artifacts on pages 50 and 58</A></H2>
The most important depends on the project: what shines the most light
on the dark areas of the project.
<p>
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 48 -- Inception -- Which requirements first">Chapter 4 pp 48 -- Inception -- Which requirements first</A></H2>
We do not need to define all the requirements in the inception phase, but
which one should I choose as the first and how to choose?
<p>
The book goes into more detail later.  But here are some simple thoughts:
<br><ol class="List">
<li>The least useful use case is the one that is easy and straightforward
to do and doesn't teach you anything as a result.
Example: user logs in.
<li>It must be <span class="InlineFormula">interesting</span>.
Example: User uses a credit card from a remote ATM that needs access to
another banks records.
<li>Attack risks before the attack you.
So -- go for the scary requirements first.
Example: We need to use a completely new point of sale terminal
and it hasn't even been built yet...  we need to test the prototype.
<li>Look for &quot;show stopper requirements&quot; that just have to be met or
else the project is dead.
Example: we have to show the user that we can get money out of the user!
<li>Look for things you don't know or understand.  Example -- new technology.
Examples: how do web services work?  What is Struts? We are going to be
using Ruby!
<li>Look for a use case that will involve many parts of the software.
<li>What is the most problematic requirement?

<H2><a name="Chapter number pp 41-59 -- Inception">Chapter number pp 41-59 -- Inception</A></H2>
The book makes passing mention that you can use UML during Inception. But
isn't this just elaboration? How can UML be used in the inception with out
being an elaboration?
<p>
The tools do not determine the phase.  Inception differs from Elaboration
in terms of attitude.   In inception you know that you may
kill the project and are trying to prove that it is worth doing.
In elaboration -- you expect for the project to run to completion
and have cracked the most difficult problems.
<p>
After inception you should have a better idea of how much work is
going to be needed -- in the next phase.  During the remaining phases you
plan one iteration ahead and refine the overall plan.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4.1 pp 48 -- Inception">Chapter 4.1 pp 48 -- Inception</A></H2>
So inception is the key to determining if a project should be started or
not, if no one is sure if they should start it or not?
<p>
Even if you know that project has to be done -- inception is about
validating that it is worth doing.   A kind of cynical review of
the previous systems analysis.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 2/4 pp 49 -- Inception">Chapter 2/4 pp 49 -- Inception</A></H2>
Can you please provide some more analogy example like the one on section
4.1 about the oil business?
<p>
I usually use the Jungle Mission analogy -- you and your team
have been parachuted into jungle -- half the team is lost,
the objective is on your map, but you don't know where you
are.  What do you do first?
<p>
In fact this is not quite right:  Inception should start before
the team gets dropped in the jungle....  it is about making sure that
the mission is worth doing.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 49 -- How long is inception">Chapter 4 pp 49 -- How long is inception</A></H2>
In the book it states what should be completed during inception but it
doesn't state how much time should actually be spent or what a reasonable
amount of time is. How long should be spent during inception?
<p>
There is no general rule.  It depends on the unknowns in the
particular project.  But you should time box it -- ideally the
team should discuss how long it will take to kick off the
project and verify the feasibility and cost of 10% riskiest requirements.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 49 -- Inception">Chapter 4 pp 49 -- Inception</A></H2>
What is the longest amount of time a it takes for inception?
<p>
I would get very worried if it took longer than a month.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 47-51 -- inception">Chapter 4 pp 47-51 -- inception</A></H2>
Is there anytime we should not use inception?
<p>
If you have a working development environment, knowledge of
where you are, where you are going, you know what tools you will be using, etc.
then inception
boils down to having a meeting to kickoff the process.  All it has to do
is pick a few use cases to analyse in detail.
<p>
I would say that it may be a very short &quot;inception&quot; phase -- 60 minutes --
but it still exists.
<p>
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 48-49 -- Feasibility">Chapter 4 pp 48-49 -- Feasibility</A></H2>
Is there an easy way to calculate feasibility during the inception phase of
a rather large project of which no one has any prior experience doing? I've
ran into numerous problems where a group thinks they can tackle a project
only to find out halfway through that it's just not possible :(
<p>
No.  Instead each novel part of the project should be entered into the
Risk List for the project.... and tackled early in the elaboration phase.
This means you have time to adjust your plans rather than hitting the
problems
&quot;halfway through&quot;.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 50 -- artifacts">Chapter 4 pp 50 -- artifacts</A></H2>
The list of artifacts to be started in the inception phase shows 9
different documents.  This is more than what we are submitting.  Why?  Is
there a time when you wont have some of these documents?  How will you
know?
<p>
In a real project -- As a rule you should only prepare an artifact if it
teaches you something.
<p>
I don't want to kill you in the first iteration.  In previous
classes I asked people to choose what artifacts they would do
in the inception phase... but they all had CS372 projects to
start from.  Now I've reduced the number.
<p>
However I will demand certain artifacts throughout
the course so that you are forced to practice the particular skills
involved.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 047-051 -- CS320">Chapter 4 pp 047-051 -- CS320</A></H2>
Is it a good idea to include group creativity activities in the inception
stage?  (Take this wrench and use it to make that ball roll over this
object...)
<p>
Use creativity exercises when stuck.  This can happen in inception
but more typically (I guess) in later stages.
<p>
I would suggest that team building exercises -- like sharing pizza --
would very helpful in the inception phase.   Indeed, if the team is
distance challenged then the first risk that must be attacked is trust
and communication and it pays to start by doing something (as a distributed
team) that produces some tangible result -- like a really dumb prototype.
This can also exercise the infrastructure....
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 4 pp 48 -- inception">Chapter 4 pp 48 -- inception</A></H2>
What is the best method used to estimate the range of cost during
inception?
<p>
Notice that in some situations you are more interested in the effort
(people&gt;&lt;time) than with money.
<p>
(1) You can often get a &quot;ball park&quot; minimum and maximum figures for a small
project  by talking about it with your team.
<p>
(2) You may already have a cost-benefit analysis
[<A href="http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/cs372/09.html#Financial%20and%20Cost-Benefit%20Analysis"> ../cs372/09.html#Financial%20and%20Cost-Benefit%20Analysis </A>]
with some figures you can use.
<p>
(3) Here is an algorithm for a more defensible figure.
<br><ol class="List">
<li>Break down into tasks, tools, equipment...
<li>Cost each as a range.
<br>Case<ol class="Case">
<li>People -&gt; wages * time with min...max.
</ol><br>(End of Case)<br>Case<ol class="Case">
<li>Buy &amp; maintain as min..max
</ol><br>(End of Case)<br>Case<ol class="Case">
<li>Rent/lease -&gt; monthly min..max
</ol><br>(Close Case )<br>
<li>Add up the mins and maxes to give total min..max
</ol><br>
<p>
You can include the expected and most likely values and use the PERT
formula
<li><span class=Formula>expected = (min +4*likely+max)/6.</span>
<p>
There exist programs that can draw you a nice picture of the chances
of getting different times...
<p>
You could (only to impress a naive stakeholder) run a few simulations
picking random numbers in the individual pieces min-max range...
<p>
<p>
<H2><a name="4 pp 48, 51 -- Length of Inception">4 pp 48, 51 -- Length of Inception</A></H2>
This book says that inception should be only one or a few weeks long, in
what case might inception be longer, what types or sizes of projects might
increase the length of the inception phase?
If the inception takes too long does that mean the project is not possible?
and how would you solve this...
<p>
If it takes more than &quot;a few&quot; weeks to decide whether the project is worth
doing and what (in outline) what is required.... the project is not ready
to start the UP development process.
It needs more analysis.  There are probably some political and
resource problems to resolve.  To continue is very risky.
See CSCI372!
<p>
It is best to have a fixed deadline and fill the time with as much analysis
and design than to have specified a set of requirements to be achieved and
have these take up a lot of time.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 2/4 pp 54 -- Evolutionary vs Waterfall">Chapter 2/4 pp 54 -- Evolutionary vs Waterfall</A></H2>
What are some of the Evolutionary requirements and some of the waterfalls
and what are key differences between them?
<p>
Evolution vs Waterfall is not a quality of a particular requirement.
<p>
It is a property of how you plan to do the work.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 5 pp 54-55 -- Waterfall">Chapter 5 pp 54-55 -- Waterfall</A></H2>
How do you decide if your project is starting the waterfall process? The
way it is described in the book seems too vague for me.  Some people could
think that there are too many requirements at first while other people
think that the requirements are in a healthy range.
<p>
You know it is waterfall when people think they have (or will have)
a complete unchanging software requirements specification
before they start designing the software.
<p>
OK there is a slippery slope.... and this book suggests that you
shouldn't expect more than 10% of the requirements to be fixed
before you start designing, coding, testing, and elaborating
the software.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 5 pp 54 -- Waterfall Requirements">Chapter 5 pp 54 -- Waterfall Requirements</A></H2>
The author obviously likes the evolutionary method, but is there ever a
time that the Waterfall method would be useful?
<p>
Waterfall is excellent in classrooms:-)
<p>
See next question.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 5 pp 56 -- Evolutionary requirements">Chapter 5 pp 56 -- Evolutionary requirements</A></H2>
Throughout the earlier chapter and including this chapter (ch.5) there is
mention of waterfall approach and a constant reminder not to superimpose
the waterfall approach to UP. when is waterfall approach useful ? and if
45% of waterfall specified features are never used,(figure 5.1) is it a
useful and successful approach?
<p>
You need to be absolutely certain of the situation and requirements, and
be sure that they will not change until after when you complete the
project.
These tend to be small, closed problems like
<span class="InlineFormula">calculate the square root of a number</span>.
<p>
<H2><a name="Chapter 5 pp 57 -- Categories of requirements">Chapter 5 pp 57 -- Categories of requirements</A></H2>
The book mentions that some feel that the requirement categories functional
and non-functional are too broad.  What do they mean?  How can they be
broken down further?
<p>
The book uses the FURPS+
[<A href="patterns.html#FURPS+"> patterns.html#FURPS+ </A>]
and I've used
[<A href="patterns.html#PQRST"> patterns.html#PQRST </A>]
in my projects.  Also

When should the F.U.R.P.S model be applied to a project?
<p>
From the beginning until transition (at least) you need some kind of
framework  or checklist to make sure you have covered all the requirements.
This is something that the whole team knows.  It has to be a short
mnemonic.   Larman uses FURPS+.  I use PQRST.
<p>
You use it initially to ask questions: How fast? How frequently?
How friendly? How secure? What does it do? How much disk space? Which
platform? ...
<p>
In your project I don't require you to use FURPS+.  BUT you
must not miss any requirements.

<H2><a name="Chapter 6 Page 45 -- Alternatives to use cases">Chapter 6 Page 45 -- Alternatives to use cases</A></H2>
Are there alternatives to the Use-Case Model?
<p>
Yes -- but they are out of favor.

Note:  you should add business/domain models and a glossary to your use cases.
