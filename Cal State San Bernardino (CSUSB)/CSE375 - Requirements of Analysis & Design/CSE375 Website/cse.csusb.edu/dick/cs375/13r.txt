 What happens to a system operation in an SSD when you start to design objects
to handle it.
 Explain operation contracts.
 What is the function of the domain model when you are designing objects?

 What are the relations between an interaction diagram and a DCD that supports it?
 How do you show iterations in an communication diagram?
 Explain the Command-Query Separation Principle
 An object `a:A` sends message `m` to `b:B`. Draw a communication diagram
that shows this.  What does this diagram tell us about the
classes `A` and `B` -- list `all` the facts you can deduce.
 Class `A` is a generalization of of Class `B` and class `B` is associated
with class `C`.  Draw the DCD showing these facts.  Are objects in class 
`A` also assoicated with objects of class `C`?
 Write down what the following diagram means as a set of true facts about 
the classes:
