Next class
.See ./09.html
will introduce a way to organize your software, and your projects
so that different aspects (example the user interface and
the data base management system) are kept separate and as independent
as possible.  This makes it easier to change software.

You should present your project's first domain/business model.  Give
me a copy to comment on and grade.

There will be a quiz to test to see if you can draw a plausible and corrct
SSD for a given scenario.

.See ./grading/

Also see this article in Wired (`Wired`!) 
.See http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/
about why it pays to record our thinking before we write the code...  Experiences
like this guy's (he is a good programmer by the way) make me believe in the
recording of our thinking as we work out what is required and how we meet the
requirements...

. 2011-03-03 Thu Mar  3 10:15 Iterative Engineering Illustrated
You'll need flash for this
.See http://i.usatoday.net/tech/graphics/iss_timeline/flash.htm
and it shows a complex piece of hardware growing as it is in use.

Two questions:  How come all the pieces fit together?
Did the engineers learn and improve their designs as each module was deployed?

. 2008-02-15 Fri Feb 15 14:02 Philosophy of Iterative Program Development
Here is a description of the philosophy behind iterative software Development as
expressed by Piet Hein, and quoted by Dr. Yair Censor on Wednsday:
.Set
	The road to wisdom?
	Well it's plain & simple to express:
	Err and err, and err again
	but less, and less, and less.

Also quoted by Donald Knuth in his notes on "Mathematical Writing".

Thanx to Dan Piedlow for reminding me of this...

. 2007-12-10 Mon Dec 10 10:12 Upgrading site to Winter 2008
The big change for the coming quarter is removing dynamic modeling (activity diagrams and State Charts) from the course -- and spending more time on
the $GRASP and $GoF patterns.

Here are the grade distributions from precious classes:
