.Open Review Questions 11 -- UML Design Class Diagrams
 What is the purpose and form of a DCD? How does it relate to a Domain Model?
 Invent an example and use it to demonstrate three different ways of showing an attribute in a UML
class diagram.
 What information can you attach to an operation in a UML DCD?
 How do you document the code for an operation in a UML DCD?
  Explain "keyword", "constraint", and "stereotype" as used in the UML.
  Draw a diagram that illustrates (using your own invented example) "generalization".
  What is an "abstract" class?
  How do you show that class `A` depends on class `B`.  Give an two examples
of a dependency between `A` and `B`.
  How do you show an "interface" in the UML?  (several answers needed).
  Does aggregation <>----- mean anything -- discuss.
  What does "composition" mean in the standard for the UML?  
  What does an association class do?
  On facebook you can specify that you are in a relationship and its status.
How doe you use an assoication class "Relationship" to track the connections
between Facebook "Users"?
  What is a singleton class?
  How do you show templatized classes in the UML?
 Give an example from C++ STL or Java.
  What is an "active class".

 Explain the following diagams and their parts...

.Image 11diagram.png [Use case to DCD]
 A `Widget` has  method called `zark` with data `knobs:Number` 
Draw a sequence diagram and a communication diagram showng 
that when a `Widget` gets a `zark(knobs)` message it creates a `Wodget` 
called `kid` with parameter `knobs` and then sends `kid` a `foobar` message.
-- draw a partial DCD that supports this interaction. 
 An object `a:A` gets a message `m1` and as a result sends message `m2` to
`b:B`. Draw a sequence diagram
that shows this.  What does this tell us about the
classes `A` and `B` -- list all the facts you can deduce from this interaction.
Sketch a partial DCD that supports this interaction and shows as many facts as
you can.
 How do DCDs and interaction diagrams relate?
. Exercises on Interaction Diagrams if time
 Translate given communication diagram to a sequence diagram.
and vice versa.... and draw part of a DCD for both.

.See ./11XY.png

 Use interaction diagrams to develop a class diagram that supports
the interactions.

 Use a pair of a communication and a sequence diagram of the same
collaboration to fill in blanks.

 Here is a domain model and a communication diagram from the last class
.See ./10ExGetUnfilledInteract.html
(thank you Visio).  Redraw the Domain class diagram as a Design Class Diagram that
supports the communications shown.

 Time to recall or reconstruct the domain model of the objects in a classroom for
an inventory of the CSUSB campus.  Add some generalizations and more general classes.
