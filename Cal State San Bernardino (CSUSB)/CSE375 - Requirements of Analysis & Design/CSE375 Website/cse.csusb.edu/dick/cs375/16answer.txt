	Information Expert
	Creator
	High Cohesion
	Low Coupling
	Controler

	Polymorphism
	Pure Fabrication
	Indirection
	Protected Variations

Now can you write a short (1..3 sentences) description of what
each of these are about?

Can you match them up to these statements?
.Set
	Reduce coupling by connecting to an intermediate object.
	Objects should be created by their friends.
	When all else fails: try inventing an object: can you get good cohesion and low coupling?
	Allocate a task to the object knows where the data is.
	Minimize connections between pieces of code.
	Handle behavior variations in subclasses and use pointers to general
superclasses.
	Make each piece of code do a set of closely related things.
	Use a high level object to guide a use case.
.Close.Set
