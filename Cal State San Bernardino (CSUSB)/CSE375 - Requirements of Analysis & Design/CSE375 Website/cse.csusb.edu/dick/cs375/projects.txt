.Open Assigned field / Project work
. Teams
The ideal team size is about 4.
. Plan
The work is assigned on a Thursday so you have more days to do it. 
There will be time at the end of each Thursday class to
start each iteration.  

The work is
timeboxed: Present what you have at the start of the class when it is due.  

Give me the $Deliverables then.

Exception -- the final version of the project is due at the start of
the final.  

Project deliverables can be hard copy or a link plus access to
the information on the web.   If you elect to put artifacts on the web
keep with the safer formats: .html, .txt, .pdf, .gif, .jpg.

You are building up a packet of artifacts, increment by increment.
In theory source code, tests, and executables would be a major part
of each iteration.... but we won't have time in this class to do this.
