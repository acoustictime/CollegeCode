.Open W0 Project Kickoff
. Goals for W0
A vision for a project.

You know each other's names and EMail addresses and set up
communications so that every
thing you produce -- every artifact -- is seen by more than one person,
has two copies (on different systems),
and is easy to revise.  
There is a lot to be said for setting up a web site to act as repository for 
all your artifacts.  Some teams have used Google docs and DropBox
in the past.
. Process for W0
In groups, start in class but work on outside class,
I will visit each team to give advice and encouragement.

.Open Deliverables for W0
The deliverables form a packet and every element in the packet should
be there in the listed order.
