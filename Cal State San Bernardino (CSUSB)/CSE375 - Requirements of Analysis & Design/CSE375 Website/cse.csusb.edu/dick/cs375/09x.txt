 What UML diagram do you use to plan the organization of a complex piece of software?
Give a simple example.
 What is a dependency in the UML? How do you show it and what does it mean?
 What is the relationship between the Domain Model and the Domain Layer?
 Explain the model-view separation principle.
 Explain the relationships between a dynamic model and a static model of an interaction.
 I have a dynamic model that shows a message `m` being passed 
from class `A` to class `B`.  Where do I put `m` in the static model?
 Draw an interaction diagram that shows that an object `a` in class `A`
sends a message `m`(`d`) to an object `b` of class B.
 Draw a plausible static Design class diagram that supports the interaction
in the previous question.
