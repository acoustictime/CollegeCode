you have to manually go in and setup the pointers and in order to get the permissions right you have to open the console as apache and make the first update
it was actually really cool
and took patrick like 3 visits to dumb it down enough for us to understand
and of course the ldap setup sucked
all three of us wrote pieces of that how to and it kind of shows lol
it doesnt exactly flow very well
but if the redmine part is really easy
